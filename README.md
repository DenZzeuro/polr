Polr
==================

###A beautiful, modern, fast, minimalist, and open-source URL shortening platform in vanilla PHP. 
Polr is an enterprise-class open-source link shortening web application designed to operate at many scales, built on the Software-as-a-Service paradigm. It allows you to host your own URL shortener, to brand your URLs, and to gain control over your data. Polr is especially easy to use, and provides a modern, themable feel.

Installation
==================

 - Unpack Polr, or clone the git repo. Only the `git clone` option allows quick updating through `git pull`.
 - Go to the root of your Polr folder (on webserver)
 - Read `INSTALL.txt`
 - You're ready to go! Check back for updates, and `git pull` if possible to update Polr. Otherwise, you can download a ZIP from Github and replace your current files. Make sure to keep your `config.php`!
 - Note: *please* disable errors on your server if you plan to use Polr in production. Certain warnings are normal, and you should not panic. It is not only unsafe but having errors shown also clutters the interface.

Prerequisites:

- mod_rewrite (install help: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-mod_rewrite)
- MySQL or MariaDB equivalent >= 5.5
- PHP >= 5.3
- Apache httpd or nginx (no out-of-box compatibility with nginx) 
- MySQLi extension for PHP
- MySQLnd (native driver; i.e php5-mysqlnd on Ubuntu)
- MCrypt (http://www.php.net//manual/en/book.mcrypt.php)

Most hosts include these prerequisites in PHP stacks, so you probably won't have to install them yourself.
